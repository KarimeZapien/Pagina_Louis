                        <pre>
    I know you say you know me, know me well
    But these days I don't even know myself, no
    I always thought I'd be with someone else
    I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah
    I call you but you never even answer
    I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
    But then I get so numb with all the laughter
    That I forget about the pain
    Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
    You drag me down, you fuck me up
    We're on the ground, we're screaming
    I don't know how to make it stop
    I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
    But I keep on coming back to you
    I know my friends they give me bad advice
    Like move on, get you out my mind
    But don't you think I haven't even tried?
    You got me cornered and my hands are tied
    You got me so addicted to the drama
    I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
    But then I get so numb with all the laughter
    That I forget about the pain
    Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
    You drag me down, you fuck me up
    We're on the ground, we're screaming
    I don't know how to make it stop
    I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
    But I keep on coming back to you (back to you)
    Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you (back to you)
    Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you
    And I guess you'll never know
    All the bullshit that you put me through
    And I guess you'll never know, no
    Yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
    You can be the pill to ease the pain
    'Cause I know I'm addicted to your drama
    Baby, here we go again
    Whoa, you stress me out, you kill me
    You drag me down, you fuck me up
    We're on the ground, we're screaming
    I don't know how to make it stop
    I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
    But I keep on coming back to you (back to you)
    Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you (back to you)
    Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you
    Back to you
    I just keep on coming back to you

                        <pre>
    Wish that you could build a time machine
    So you could see
    The things no one can see
    Feels like you're standing on the edge
    Looking at the stars
    And wishing you were them
    ‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
    ‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
    ‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
    ‪You can be who you were or who you'll become
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling just hold on
    ‪The sun goes down and it comes back up
    ‪The world it turns no matter what
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
    Darling, just hold on
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling, just hold on
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
    It's not over 'til it's all been said
    ‪It's not over 'til your dying breath
    ‪So what do you want them to say when you're gone?‬
    ‪That you gave up or that you kept going on?‬
    ‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
    ‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
    ‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
    ‪You can be who you were or who you'll become
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, ‪if it all goes wrong
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling just hold on
    ‪The sun goes down and it comes back up
    ‪The world it turns no matter what
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
    Darling, just hold on
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
    Darling, just hold on
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
    If it all goes wrong
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
    Darling just hold on
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
    If it all goes wrong, darling just hold on

                    <pre>
    Sometimes, I wake up and I hear you through the silence
    You let your pride hide all your beauty and your kindness
    So fast to judge in error, you thought you knew me better
    So quick to kill forever
    You used to read me like a headline
    So many reasons now you're not mine
    Maybe if you'd taken more time
    I'd still be the one you wanna talk to every night, oh
    If you got in my head
    You wouldn't be scared of what you'd find
    You used to read me like a headline
    Oh, that's the reason now you're not mine anymore
    You spent your summer working for your education
    While I was running after dreams that kept us waiting
    You never told me, never
    Guess I never knew we'd have the shortest forever
    Thought I could but I can't forget ya
    You used to read me like a headline
    So many reasons now you're not mine
    Maybe if you'd taken more time
    I'd still be the one you wanna talk to every night, oh
    If you got in my head
    You wouldn't be scared of what you'd find
    You used to read me like a headline
    Oh, that's the reason now you're not mine anymore
    You used to read me like a headline
    You used to read me like a headline
    Sometimes, I wake up and I wish you were beside me

                    <h3>Holding On To Heartache</h3>
                    <pre>
    You said I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You said I wear it like a crown
    It's gonna drag me down
    I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You should be starin' at the sky
    The birds just passin' by, love
    The wind held us up, but
    We knew that all would change
    Creates the strangest feelin'
    Just slowly waitin' for the end
    I still have dreams about it
    The moments as they came
    The moments never shown to us
    Because we faded into darkness
    I can still hear a silence
    I can still hear a clock that's tickin'
    You said I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You said I wear it like a crown
    It's gonna drag me down
    I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You should be starin' at the sky
    The birds just passin' by, love
    Holdin' onto heartache
    The nights, they change in seasons
    Become the strangest days
    I called you twice but then regretted it
    And changed my number
    The questions that I'd asked you
    "Where did it all go wrong?"
    There's endless versions of the thing
    That keeps me driftin' back to darkness
    I can still hear your silence
    I can still hear a clock that's tickin'
    You said I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You said I wear it like a crown
    It's gonna drag me down
    I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You should be starin' at the sky
    The birds just passin' by, love
    You know the party's over
    When you're standin' in an empty space alone
    And time can always heal ya
    If you let it make its way into your bones
    Nothing's ever easy
    To be honest, I'm not easy on myself
    The second that I see ya
    The space between us just comes floodin' back
    You said I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You said I wear it like a crown
    It's gonna drag me down
    I'm holdin' onto heartache
    You should be starin' at the sky
    The birds just passin' by, love

                    <h3>Chicago</h3>
                    <pre>
    I saw you had a baby
    Did you use any of the names we liked?
    And is your brother doing okay?
    Is he still getting out of fights?
    I'm sorry that your mum don't like me
    I'm sorry that I brought that on myself
    They say bitter ends turn sweet in time
    Is that true of yours and mine?
    'Cause if you're lonely in Chicago
    You can call me baby
    Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
    Just because it didn't work
    Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
    It just wasn't meant to be
    Have you seen how my life's been going?
    'Cause I've been wondering what you'd say
    Would you have told me to keep going
    Or would you say to walk away?
    You always made me feel much better
    And I'll always be grateful for that
    They say bitter ends turn sweet in time
    If that's true for yours and mine
    And you feel lonely in Chicago
    You can call me baby
    Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
    Just because it didn't work
    Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
    I didn't have to search 'cause I still know your number
    I bet that you didn't think that I'd remember
    Just because it didn't work
    Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
    It just wasn't meant to be
    It just wasn't meant to be
    No, it just wasn't meant to be
    It just wasn't meant to be
    So if you're lonely in Chicago
    You can call me baby
    Has it been long enough that you can forgive me?
    Just because it didn't work
    Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
    Oh, I didn't have to search 'cause I still know your number
    I bet sometimes you still like to wear my jumper
    Just because it didn't work
    Doesn't mean it's meaningless to me
    It just wasn't meant to be
